## My Neovim configurations

## To set up :

1. Install [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
2. Clone the repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/RaZ0rr-Two/myNeovim.git`
3. Place the nvim folder inside `~/.config` folder ( `~` is your `$HOME` directory, i.e., `/home/<username>` ):  
`cp -r myNeovim/nvim ~/.config/`

That's pretty much it. Start neovim with `nvim` inside terminal or however you want and enjoy.  
( Note ⚠️ : opening neovim first time may throw errors. Close errors by pressing `<C-c>` (control + c) and type `:PackerInstall`. Might have to try this two times but it will fully setup after that)
